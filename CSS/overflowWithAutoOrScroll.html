      London’s emphasis on services rather than manufacturing helped it to
      sidestep the worst fall-out from Brexit. Between 2016 and 2021 London’s
      exports of services grew by 47%. London’s status as a global financial
      centre remains intact even as its dominance within Europe has been eroded;
      it is a vibrant centre for tech startups. Politicians in America, Europe
      and Britain itself are shovelling subsidies towards manufacturing, but
      London is a reminder that high-value services—from law to coding,
      consulting to higher education—can be a better source of growth, jobs and
      innovation.
